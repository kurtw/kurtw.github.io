## Summary
I got my start working in the tech industry with autonomous vehicles, this is where I learned the magic of various game development tools. 
I love learning new things, and am always happy to volunteer to jump into unfamiliar territory. 
For me, it's the journey that counts, and I try to enjoy every last second of it.
